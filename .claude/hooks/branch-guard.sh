# PreToolUse guard for this repo's files. Two rules, in order:
#   1. The shared MAIN checkout (the primary worktree) is read-only for edits.
#      Topic work MUST happen in an isolated linked worktree, because the main
#      checkout's HEAD is shared and another concurrent session can switch it
#      out from under you mid-task — a commit then lands on the wrong branch.
#   2. Inside a linked worktree, edits on main/master are still denied.
# So the ONLY place edits are allowed is a linked worktree on a non-main branch.
# Enforces .claude/skills/dev-workflow/SKILL.md ("no changes on main; one
# worktree per topic").
